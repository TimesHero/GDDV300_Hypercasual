Assignment 2: F2P Hypercasual Game Design

Now is the time to begin the next assignment. You will have the rest of the term to complete it. Read carefully through the instructions below: 

OBJECTIVE: F2P Game Design Hypercasual

This will be a group assignment. You will want to set up the project pipeline as soon as possible. This is NOT a design for a mobile phone. For the purposes of this assignment, you may design your hypercasual game for a PC. 

Remember that a hypercasual game is a mobile video game which is easy to play and usually free-to-play. They also feature very minimalistic user interfaces. 
PART I: Designing a Hypercasual Game

    In the previous module, you designed your own hypercasual game. 
    When you meet with your group, you will share your game concept. The group will choose which game idea will be developed further. 
    Give some thought to the points below when selecting which game to develop further as a group: 
    Establishing the scope. How big will this game be?
    Time management - take into account how much time your group members have and the deadline for this assignment.
    Skill level/design ability of the group. Does your group have the ability to create the selected game?

PART II: Project Management Pipeline

    Join the Slack channel for your group and start adding daily standups to the channel.
    Keep Slack running so you can get notifications.
    You and your group may choose to communicate through Discord but Slack must be used for standups and communication with me.
    Tasking and Weekly Sprints
    As you did in your project management course, use Trello, HacknPlan, or any other project management software for tasking and weekly sprints.
    The choice of project management software is really up to you but you should be getting in the habit of tracking your work. 
    Set up a repo using bitbucket, git or whatever you wish to use for your group.
    Remember not to upload libraries. Make sure not to ignore the correct folders.
    Ask all group members to download the repo to their machine as you did in the project management class. Make certain all group members can push and pull to and from the repo.

Notify your instructor which of your hypercasual games you will be developing by the end of the week on Sunday, 11:59 PM. Announce in Discord which game you have chosen, cite the name, and the mechanic, and add a brief description. This is important modelling for industry-level communication.
